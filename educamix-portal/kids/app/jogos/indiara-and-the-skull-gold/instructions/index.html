			The game <strong>Indiara and the Gold Skull</strong> was developed using the program Construct 2, the Scirra. The sounds, music and layout were all developed specifically for the game, and you can change them as you wish.

			The game adapts according to the size you want, but even then I did with two resolutions, <strong>640x480px</strong> and <strong>840x480px</strong>.
			<br>
			<br>
			The lower resolution of <strong>640x480px</strong> is squarer, and will not appear very level. But a resolution is widely used and recommended for gaming.
			<br>
			<br>
			Advise at the time of entering the game in your site, use the resolution <strong>840x480px</strong>. It appears more level, more graphics, and the field of view increases the pleasure of playing.

			To embed a game in your website is very simple, just use an <strong>iframe</strong> on the page that you want the game to appear. Follow the steps below:
            <br>
			<br>
			1 - The games are in this directory: <strong>indiara-and-the-skull-gold/game</strong>. The games with iframe ready with a bg done this in this folder: <strong>indiara-and-the-skull-gold/game_iframe</strong>
			<br>
			2 - Copy the folder with the game on the resolution chosen folder to your server. Decorate the directory name, because you'll need to put in the iframe.
            <br>
			3 - On the page that you want the game to appear, copy the following code in html:
			<br>
            <br>
            <strong>
			&lt;iframe src=&quot;gamefolder/index.html&quot; width=&quot;840px&quot; height=&quot;480px&quot;&gt; &lt;/ iframe&gt;
            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
			4 - Where is "gamefolder" you put the entire directory to where you put the game on your server, example: "games/adventure/indiara".
            <br>
			5 - If you want to change the size of the game will appear on your website, simply modify the "width" and "height". You can use whatever size you want, because the game will adjust alone.
			<br>
            <br>
			For the game appears alone on the page itself, just use their own "index.html" which is in the game folder.

			To edit the images of the game, no need to leave the program. Just replace them. Follow the steps below.
            <br>
            <br>
            1 - The pictures are in this directory: <strong>indiara-and-the-skull-gold/game/640x480px/images</strong> and <strong>indiara-and-the-skull-gold/game/840x480px/images</strong>
            <br>
            2 - Make sure the image you want to replace has the same dimensions of the original.
            <br>
            3 - Always save in PNG, because if you save as jpeg, it will not work, because it lacks transparency.
            <br>
            4 - Replace the original image you created.
            <br>
            5 - Okay, now try the game!
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Important: You should always make a backup before editing, because you may want to recover the original file.</strong>
