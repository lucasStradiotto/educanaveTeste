			The game <strong>Game FlapCat Steampunk</strong> was developed using the program Construct 2, the Scirra. The game can be viewed on almost all internet browsers. Included is touch, and can be opened in phones and tablets.
            <br>
			<br>
            The game also is auto-resizable! The game was developed in resolution <strong>1280x720px (HD)</strong>. You can use any size in height and width, but it gets better in the original resolution. Another suggestion is <strong>860x480px</strong> resolution, which also in this file.<br>
			<br>
            Tip: Always use the latest version of the program more stable Construct.

			To embed a game in your site is very simple, just copy the folder to your server. The folder with the game ready is this:
			<br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_folders_03.png">
            <br>
            <br>
			1 - Copy the folder to your server. Feel free to rename the folder.
            <br>
			2 - In this application example of the game, it resizes to the size of longs player. It is advisable to keep the default size of 1280x720px but you can use the full screen game, because it adjusts to any size.
            <br>
            3 - I added the size of 860x480px, because this size is easier to put on most sites.

            </div>
            <div id="contentTxt">
            Try to use your site in the game with iframe, to experience the best player. In this mode the game keeps the original dimensions.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the file that you have purchased contains an iframe ready for you to use! The page ready in this directory:

            <br>
            <img src="images/img_folders_04.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to change the iframe page, follow the steps below:
			<br>
            <br>
			1 - Copy the folder with the game on the resolution chosen folder to your server. Decorate the directory name, because you'll need to put in the iframe.
            <br>
			2 - On the page that you want the game to appear, copy the following code in html:
			<br>
            <br>
            <strong>
			&lt;iframe src=&quot;gamefolder/index.html&quot; width=&quot;860px&quot; height=&quot;480px&quot;&gt; &lt;/ iframe&gt;
            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
			3 - Where is "gamefolder" you put the entire directory to where you put the game on your server, example: <strong>"games/adventure/flapcat"</strong>.
            <br>
			4 - If you want to change the size of the game will appear on your website, simply modify the "width" and "height". You can use whatever size you want, because the game will adjust alone.

			To edit the images of the game, no need to leave the program. Just replace them. Follow the steps below.
            <br>
            <br>
            1 - The pictures are in this directory: <strong>game_flapcat_steampunk/game/images</strong> or <strong>game_flapcat_steampunk/game_iframe/game/images</strong>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>2 - Make sure the image you want to replace has the same dimensions of the original.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_image_01.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            3 - Always save in PNG, because if you save as jpeg, it will not work, because it lacks transparency.
            <br>
            4 - Replace the original image you created.
            <br>
            5 - Okay, now try the game!
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Important: You should always make a backup before editing, because you may want to recover the original file.</strong>
